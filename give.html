                    Prepare yourself to be as helpful as possible. The way you interact with someone else's work can effect how they see it themselves.
                    Treat it with respect. Remember that you are working with someone to make their project stronger. It is not you versus them - it is us
                    working together to create the best version of the work possible.

                                    <h3>Ask first</h3>
                                    <h4>Ask for permission and direction before giving feedback on someone's work.</h4>

                                        This acknowledges their ownership and investment in the work and gives them a certain amount of control over a process
                                        that can put them in a fairly vulnerable position. What they want and where they are in their process will guide you as
                                        a reviewer to give helpful and actionable feedback.
                                    </p>

                                        <h3>Make it visible</h3>
                                        <h4>Write on the work to show any feedback and post it for everyone to see.</h4>

                                            This creates an artifact that will help the person receiving the feedback to remember what was said about their work.
                                            It also communicates to everyone involved that the work being shown is not precious - just a part of a process. It takes
                                            the pressure off of any single student's work and normalizes critiquing for everyone.

                                        <h4>Start the critique with a smile - and maybe even make people laugh.</h4>

                                            Smiling communicates that you want to be there and will make others want to be there with you. It signals that you are
                                            approaching the process with a positive attitude - making it easier for someone to receive your feedback with an open mind.
                                            While some critiques may need to be fairly serious in nature most are more effective and more fun if you approach them with
                                            a sense of humor.

                                    Keep in mind that the goal of a critique is to improve the work being assessed - not just to hear your thoughts
                                    on that work. That MAY look like you speaking the whole time but more often than not an effective critique 
                                    includes some back and forth exchange of ideas between the designer and the person delivering the critique. 
                                    Critique "with" not "at" someone.
                                </p>

                                    The least helpful critique is one in which nothing actionable is shared. Being "nice" or making the designer feel
                                    good is not the goal of a critique and will not help the designer to improve their work. As someone giving feedback 
                                    it is your responsibility to say what needs to be said in order to take the work to the next level.

                                    It's easy for a designer to lose sight of the group that they are designing for on a project. You can bring an important
                                    "audience check" to the critique to make sure the designer's work is appropriate for the right people. Ask the designer
                                    how each element in the work makes it more or less accessible to their intended audience.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Call attention to what is working well and build off that success in other areas of the design.</h4>

                                    Often the majority of the content in a critique is about what needs to be changed but it's also important to highlight
                                    what is working. This helps the designer know what they should protect in their design as well as what they might want
                                    to build onto as they make changes to other areas of their work.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Identify and assess the use of a visual language in the work.</h4>

                                    Once a language of consistent visual elements is established in a design that "visual language" becomes a standard by which
                                    you can judge the "fit" of any one design element into the work as a whole. Is there a consistent visual language being used
                                    in the work? If so, discuss which elements were chosen to make up that visual language. Look for parts of the work that "break"
                                    that language and discuss.
                                </p>

                                    When you encounter the work for the first time take note of its visual hierarchy - what you see first and how it
                                    affects you, what you see second, third, etc... Sharing this experience can help the designer understand what sort
                                    of hierarchy they've built into their design and if that organization of elements accomplishes their goals or needs
                                    to be adjusted in future iterations.
