                                        Highlighting the difference between objective and subjective content is important because we critique both types of content 
                                        differently. Objective content is often easily agreed upon by both the creator of the work being considered and the person 
                                        delivering the critique. This makes objective content easier to critique without feeling personal - “This work is supposed
                                         to be 10” wide and yours is only 9” wide.” For critiques between people who don’t already have a relationship this is a 
                                         good, “safe” place to start.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Subjective content is less concrete and more open for personal interpretation - there’s often no “right” answer. 
                                        This can be more difficult to critique for people new to the process or without a relationship with others involved
                                         in the critique, but critiquing subjective content is often the majority of what needs to be critiqued. 
                                         Rather than measuring the work against clearly defined objective expectations the person delivering the crit must 
                                         use existing elements in the work and their own reaction to the work to give helpful feedback to improve the work.
                                    </p>        
                                    <p>
                                        Recognizing that both objective and subjective content exists and needs to be considered can help a person 
                                        delivering a critique to cover everything that needs to be considered in a crit. It can also inform how the
                                         reviewer talks about the work - more directly about objective and possibly more “gentle” about the subjective.

                                            Opinion is not the same thing as authority. It can be easy as someone delivering a critique to think that 
                                            your role gives you a position of authority - but that’s not the case. You bring your opinion to a 
                                            critique - the person receiving the critique gets to decide if they are going view you as someone who has 
                                            some amount of authority behind that opinion.

                                    <p>
                                            The person delivering feedback in a critique should consider for themselves whether they are bringing 
                                            opinion, authority or some combination of both the the critique. This self awareness should inform how 
                                            they communicate their critique of the work - tone, confidence, giving feedback vs asking questions, 
                                            use of humor, explanation of their thinking, etc…
                                    </p>
                                    <p>        
                                            Remember that it’s easy to form opinions - it’s hard to earn authority. That being said, don’t miss out on
                                            good feedback just because someone doesn’t have the authority you think necessary. Often times, the best
                                            advice comes from someone new to a specific area or project.

                                            These two words are important to define clearly before bringing critique into a group. The negative aspects
                                            of the word “cynical” are often unfairly associated with the term “critical”. While someone being critical
                                            of you can be a negative experience there are also many times in which critical feedback is not only not 
                                            negative but a positive and even enjoyable experience. In a healthy studio participants are often excited
                                            about and look forward to participating in critiques.

                                            On the other hand, a cynical attitude toward critiquing (whether that comes from the presenter or reviewer
                                            of the work) brings nothing of value to the interaction and, if anything, stalls the creative process.

                                        There is a big difference between Critique and Direction.

                                        When you critique a piece of work you are sharing either your own
                                        experience of the work or sometimes how you imagine others might experience that work. This feedback is useful to a 
                                        designer as it reveals to them how their work is actually affecting you as a viewer 
                                            (rather than how they thought it would affect you). If the work isn't doing what they thought or hoped it would 
                                            this gives them an opportunity to adjust the work in order to produce a reaction more in line with their intentions.
                                        Many critiques stop here and let the designer make their own decisions about how to alter 
                                        the work to improve it. This is often the extent of critique that is expected. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>        
                                            Direction is taking the next step of suggesting or telling the designer what specific actions to take in order to improve their 
                                            work based on the Critique given. Depending on the expectation of the person receiving the critique this type of input
                                            can be seen as very helpful or very intrusive.
                                            As a person delivering a critique it's important that you enter into
                                            the crit with a clear understanding of what the person receiving the critique is expecting to get out of the interaction.
