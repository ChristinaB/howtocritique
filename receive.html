                    You're about to receive feedback from someone who is dedicating their time and energy to making your work better. Preparing
                    for your critique communicates that you value the investment someone else is making in you and helps to ensure that the interaction
                    is as helpful as possible. The steps below will help you get the most out of your critique.

                                        Yes, this means at full size but it also includes showing your work as close to finished as possible to allow
                                        the person giving the critique to provide you with the best feedback. So, show your work at full size, in color,
                                        in the correct format, and on whatever substance you plan on delivering in your final work.

                                        <h3>Respect your work</h3>
                                        <h4>Display your work in a way that shows you care and that you're taking this seriously.</h4>

                                            You want others to take your work seriously - show that you do the same. Print on nice paper, use the best
                                            printer possible, trim with clean lines, and don't show bent or wrinkled work. Remember that the presentation
                                            can be as important as the work itself. A good critique will often include feedback on your work as well as
                                            how you show that work.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Start the critique with a confident description of your work.</h4>
                                    </button>
                                    <div class="content">

                                            If you feel the need to start a critique by apologizing for your work it probably shouldn't be in a critique
                                            at all. Many people default to apologizing when presenting their work - not only does that not make people
                                            excited to look at your work but it also makes it more difficult for a person giving a critique to be honest
                                            and open with their feedback. Confidently presenting your work is not boasting - it shows that you take your
                                            work seriously and that it's worth critiquing. 
                                        </p>

                                <h4>Show the person that is critiquing your work that you are interested in what they are saying.</h4>

                                    It's a horrible experience to give a critique to someone who is communicating to you that they don't want to be there.
                                    You want to make it as easy as possible for your reviewer to help you refine your work. Showing your interest in their
                                    opinion will make the critique a more positive experience for everyone involved and will bring you more feedback.
                                </p>

                                    All critiques are different - some include a lot of back and forth - some are just a one-way flow of feedback.
                                    Be ready for the possibility that you may not be able to ask specific questions or direct the critique towards
                                    certain areas of your work. Even if you don't get the chance to vocalize your thoughts the practice of thinking
                                    through your work will inform better future iterations.

                                    Be sure to check and double check what reviewer's expectations are about what you will be showing in the
                                    critique and do your best to align with those expectations. It sounds simple, but showing up to a critique
                                    with the wrong work is a wasted opportunity for feedback and reflects very poorly on you as a designer.

                                    Critiques can feel like drinking out of a fire hose - there's a lot of information coming at you and chances
                                    are you won't remember all of it once the critique is finished. Take notes on what's being said or ask someone
                                    to take them for you. You'll appreciate them later and it communicates to the person giving the critique that
                                    you're taking them and their feedback seriously.

                                    Knowing what you need to get out of a critique can be really helpful in setting you up for good feedback from
                                    a reviewer. While some critiques are established in their goals many allow for some direction from the person 
                                    whose work is being reviewed. If there are certain things you'd like to discuss in your critique be vocal
                                    about them rather than sitting back and hoping that the reviewer will comment on those areas.
